## About

The "Wolnowarze" is an old project that I wanted to develop some time ago but had no concept for it.
It turned out to be perfect for learning React along with a combination of Django and DRF. 

All recipes are downloaded automatically from crockpot.pl website. 
Maybe thanks to this site you will be convinced to Slow Cooker as I am :)
Enjoy!
